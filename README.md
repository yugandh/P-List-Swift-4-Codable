iOS Property List

Property List are used to store some data in a structural way that can be used on later. In raw form the property lists are in XML format. The data is stored in the form of a dictionary with key value pairs. Property lists canâ€™t store all kinds of data. They are limited to certain types of data such as arrays, dictionaries, strings, Numbers etc.
Using Codable For Property Lists
The Codable protocol is new to Swift in iOS 11 and handles converting a type to and from an external format such as JSON. It also works great for property lists.
